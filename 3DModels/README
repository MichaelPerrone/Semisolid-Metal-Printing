V1 was an attempt at using MHD extrusion of liquid metal; perhaps the parts and methods used will help someone else with their project, but it didn't end up being useful for this one. Will elaborate on that system later.
V2 is the current working system. It uses a liquid gasket to enable filament extrusion of metal in just the same way as plastic.
V2 is meant to reuse some of the parts from V1, for hooking up the system to a Prusa Mendel printer. Systems for attaching to more modern printers will come after the concept has been proven out.

The V2 parts are compatible with the parts from V1 for hooking this system up to a Prusa Mendel printer and a Bondtech extruder, The spacer with all the hexagonal cuts is meant to be laser cut out of wood.
In Lieu of instructions for now, a picture of the Onshape assembly will suffice for assembly. More detailed instructions on the way.
