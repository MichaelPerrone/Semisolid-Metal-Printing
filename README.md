# Semisolid-Metal-Printing
Extrusion system for printing metal on RepRap 3D printers.

This repository contains 3D models, firmware and software configurations for installing a semisolid metal extruder on the venerable old Prusa Mendel i2 because it is a reasonably good prototyping platform. 

Eventually it will contain the same for other common RepRaps that are more popular nowadays, perhaps to be used to make pull requests for those other projects.

See the instructions on my Hackaday page:

they are quite good at this point.
